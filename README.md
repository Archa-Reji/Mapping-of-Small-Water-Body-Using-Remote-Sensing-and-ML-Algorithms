# Mapping-of-Small-Water-Body-Using-Remote-Sensing-and-ML-Algorithms
This repository encompasses the semantic segmentation of land and water pixels utilizing the U-Net deep learning framework in the Nayagarh District of the Mahanadi River Basin, along with the deployment of water body detection by machine learning frameworks.  Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms were executed on the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine using data from two distinct satellites: Sentinel-1 SAR data and Sentinel-2 Multispectral data. The GEE code editor employed JavaScript as the programming language. The codes are also included here.
